# Graph Matching Toolkit 

**Author:** Riesen Kaspar

## Quick Start

We recommend the following three steps:

#### STEP 1:
Unzip the archive `Sources.zip`, integrate the whole framework in an IDE (e.g. Eclipse) and build the project. 

#### STEP 2:
Define a properties file in order to define the parameters of your graph matching task. In the folder `properties` you find three examples of such properties (for more details on these parameters we refer to our paper: 

*K. Riesen, S. Emmenegger and H. Bunke. A Novel Software Toolkit for Graph Edit Distance Computation.. In W.G. Kropatsch et al., editors, Proc. 9th Int. Workshop on Graph Based Representations in Pattern Recognition, LNCS 7877, 142â€“151, 2013.*

#### STEP 3:
Run the graph matching as a java application. The main method is in `GraphMatching.java`, the sole program argument is an URL pointing to the properties file (e.g.: `./properties/properties_molecules.prop`)
